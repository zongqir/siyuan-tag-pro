[简体中文](./README_zh_CN.md)

> Consistent with [siyuan/plugin-sample](https://github.com/siyuan-note/plugin-sample).

1. Use Vite for packaging
2. Use Vue3 for development
3. Provides a github action template to automatically generate package.zip and upload to new release
4. Provides a script to auto create tag and release. [link](#release-script)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Before your start, you need install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) first.

> [!WARNING]
>
> For your first attempt, please do not modify anything. Load the plugin template in Siyuan as described below before making any changes.
>
> For example, deleting README_zh_CN.md will also cause the plugin to fail to load.

## Get started

1. Use the `Use the template` button to make a copy of this repo as template.  
> [!WARNING]
>
> That the repository name should match the plugin name, and the default branch must be `main`.


2. Use `git clone` to clone the copied repo to your computer.
3. Use `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

4. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`, set the `VITE_SIYUAN_WORKSPACE_PATH` to your SiYuan workspace.


> [!TIP]
>
> If you prefer not to package the project directly into the workspace, you can use a `symbolic link` instead.
>
> Writing directly into the Siyuan workspace allows you to sync via Siyuan's sync feature to other devices, while using a symbolic link will not be included in the sync.
>
> This template does not provide specific details about symbolic links. For related information, please refer to [plugin-sample-vite-svelte](https://github.com/siyuan-note/plugin-sample-vite-svelte).

5. Use `pnpm dev` to run the project, you will see info like below

  ```

  > plugin-sample-vite-vue@0.0.1 dev /path/to/your/plugin-sample-vite-vue
  > vite build --watch

  mode=> production
  env=> {
    VITE_SIYUAN_WORKSPACE_PATH: '/path/to/siyuan/workspace',
    VITE_DEV_DIST_DIR: ''
  }

  Siyuan workspace path is set:
  /path/to/siyuan/workspace

  Plugin will build to:
  # ✅ the plugin will build into here
  /path/to/siyuan/workspace/data/plugins/plugin-sample-vite-vue

  isWatch=> true
  distDir=> /path/to/siyuan/workspace/data/plugins/plugin-sample-vite-vue
  vite v6.3.5 building for production...

  ```


   If successed, restart your siyuan, and you will find the plugin in `Siyuan - Settings - Marketplace`, named as `plugin-sample-vite-vue`.
6. Enable the plugin, and check the `App.vue` file to start your development.
   
   This file contains some example codes.

## List on the Marketplace

### Use Github Action

1. You can create a new tag, use your new version number as the `Tag version` in your local.
2. Then push the tag to Github. The Github Action will create a new Release for you.

> [!TIP]
>
> <div id="release-script"></div>This template provided a script to auto create tag and release. You can use `pnpm release` to create a patch version.
>
> You can add `--mode=manual|patch|minor|major` arg to set release mode, or run with arg like `pnpm release:manual`. 
> 
> All the scripts please see the `package.json` file.

The github action is included in this sample, you can use it to publish your new realse to marketplace automatically:

1. In your repo setting page `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/settings/actions`, down to Workflow Permissions and open the configuration like this:

![img](./asset/action.png)

2. Push a tag in the format `v*` and github will automatically create a new release with new bulit package.zip
3. By default, it will only publish a pre-release, if you don't think this is necessary, change the settings in release.yml

```yaml
- name: Release
    uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
    with.
        allowUpdates: true
        artifactErrorsFailBuild: true
        artifacts: 'package.zip'
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        prerelease: true # change this to false
```

### Manual

1. Use `pnpm build` to generate `package.zip`
2. Create a new Github release using your new version number as the "Tag version". See here for an example: https://github.com/siyuan-note/plugin-sample/releases
3. Upload the file package.zip as binary attachments
4. Publish the release

> [!NOTE]
> If it is the first release, please create a pull request to the [Community Bazaar](https://github.com/siyuan-note/bazaar) repository and modify the plugins.json file in it. This file is the index of all community plugin repositories, the format is:

```json
{
  "repos": [
    "username/reponame"
  ]
}
```
